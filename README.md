# SkyLink Customer Churn Analysis Project
## Project Overview
This repository contains the first-ever dashboard I created as part of my coursework at the NTI Institute's Data Analysis track. The project involves analyzing customer churn data for a fictional telecommunications company, SkyLink, with the goal of identifying key factors that drive customer churn and suggesting ways to improve customer retention.

The analysis primarily focuses on understanding the relationship between customer characteristics (such as contract type, payment methods, data plans, and service usage) and churn behavior. Through this project, I’ve built a series of interactive dashboards using Power BI to present actionable insights.

## Key Questions Answered:
The analysis addresses the following key business questions:

Overall Churn Rate: What is the current churn rate, and what is the most prevalent churn category?
Churn by State: Is the churn rate different per state? Which state has the highest churn rate?
Churn by Age Group: How does churn vary between different age groups? What’s the relationship between age and churn?
Group Size Impact: For customers in groups, what group size has the lowest churn rate?
Contract Type Influence: Is there a difference in churn between customers with yearly contracts and those with monthly contracts?
Unlimited Data Plan: How does having an unlimited data plan influence churn rates and data consumption (GB)?
International Activity: How does customers’ international activity (international plan, international minutes) affect churn?
Customer Service Calls Impact: What insights can we gather from the customer service calls data, and is there a relationship between customer service calls and churn?
Demographic Churn Rate: What is the churn rate for customers aged 50+ who are not in a group plan and have an account length of 12 months or less?
Payment Method and Contract Type Correlation: Is there a relationship between payment method, contract type, months of tenure, and customer churn?
Monthly Contract Direct Debit Customers: What is the average number of customer service calls for customers on a monthly contract who pay by direct debit? What is the churn rate for those customers?
Extra Data Charges: What are the average extra data charges for customers not on an unlimited data plan who consumed more than 10GB?
