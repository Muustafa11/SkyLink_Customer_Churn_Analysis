SkyLink Customer Churn Analysis Project
# Project Overview
This repository contains the first-ever dashboard I created as part of my coursework at the NTI Institute's Data Analysis track. The project involves analyzing customer churn data for a fictional telecommunications company, SkyLink, with the goal of identifying key factors that drive customer churn and suggesting ways to improve customer retention.

The analysis primarily focuses on understanding the relationship between customer characteristics (such as contract type, payment methods, data plans, and service usage) and churn behavior. Through this project, I’ve built a series of interactive dashboards using Power BI to present actionable insights.

# Key Questions Answered
The analysis addresses the following key business questions:

1-Overall Churn Rate: What is the current churn rate, and what is the most prevalent churn category?

2-Churn by State: Is the churn rate different per state? Which state has the highest churn rate?

3-Churn by Age Group: How does churn vary between different age groups? What’s the relationship between age and churn?

4-Group Size Impact: For customers in groups, what group size has the lowest churn rate?

5-Contract Type Influence: Is there a difference in churn between customers with yearly contracts and those with monthly contracts?

6-Unlimited Data Plan: How does having an unlimited data plan influence churn rates and data consumption (GB)?

7-International Activity: How does customers’ international activity (international plan, international minutes) affect churn?

8-Customer Service Calls Impact: What insights can we gather from the customer service calls data, and is there a relationship between customer service calls and churn?

9-Demographic Churn Rate: What is the churn rate for customers aged 50+ who are not in a group plan and have an account length of 12 months or less?

10-Payment Method and Contract Type Correlation: Is there a relationship between payment method, contract type, months of tenure, and customer churn?

11-Monthly Contract Direct Debit Customers: What is the average number of customer service calls for customers on a monthly contract who pay by direct debit? What is the churn rate for those customers?

12-Extra Data Charges: What are the average extra data charges for customers not on an unlimited data plan who consumed more than 10GB?

# Project Files
Dashboard Screenshots: Power BI visualizations and insights, focusing on churn analysis.
DAX Measures: DAX formulas used to calculate churn rate, customer service call averages, group size churn, and other metrics.
Dataset: The fictional customer churn data used for the analysis (not included, reference only).
Power BI Reports: The .pbix file for Power BI analysis (if applicable).
# Tools & Technologies Used
Power BI: To create interactive dashboards, charts, and visualizations.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For writing custom measures and calculated columns in Power BI.
Excel/CSV: For data wrangling and transformation before importing into Power BI.
# How to Use
Clone the Repository: Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/SkyLink_Customer_Churn_Analysis.git
Open Power BI File: If the Power BI file is included, open it using Power BI Desktop to view the dashboard and interact with the data.

Examine the DAX Measures: Review the custom DAX formulas in Power BI for a detailed understanding of how churn and other metrics were calculated.

# Future Improvements
In the future, this project can be expanded to:

Analyze customer sentiment data to understand customer service satisfaction.
Incorporate machine learning models to predict customer churn based on historical data.
Explore other business segments, such as premium customers or corporate clients, to identify unique churn drivers.

# Feedback and Contributions
As this is my first dashboard project, I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions for improvement. Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests if you have any ideas to enhance the analysis!
